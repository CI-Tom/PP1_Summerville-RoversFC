# Summerville Rovers F.C.

The aim of this project was to design a website for a local soccer club, Summerville Rovers F.C.

The club want a website to provide exposure for the club to help it grow and attract new members. The club want to provide a place for members and/or non-members to find information about the club and to be able to use the site for booking events or training slots on the pitches. As well as using the site for bookings, they also want to provide information on current teams, fixtures/results and league positions. Currently, players and members rely on external sources for information on league positions, fixtures and results. The club also wanted a gallery page showing the history of the club through old photos of the ground and teams.

The club would like, in the future, to implement their own online store to sell official club sports clothing and other items related to the club such as memorabilia and training equipment etc.
Currently this website is linked to an external store for this purpose.

  - Welcome section
  - Google Maps location
  - Footer with social media links

The Teams page includes images of all club teams with information on fixtures, results and league table.

The Contact Us page contains details of committee members with contact information for each as well as an option to book a slot on the all-weather pitch.

The Join page contains a background image of the grounds and a form to become a member of the club.

All pages contain the same header and footer.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Summerville Rovers.
  - Currently, the Facebook link is the only one that goes directly to the club's Facebook page as the club does not have any other social media accounts. The other social media links work but only take the user to the site login page. 
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

  - The teams page has in image of each team from under 8's to both men's senior teams.
  - This section is valuable to the user as it provides a glimpse of some of the recent successes of the club's teams as well as providing information on training times and coaches.
  - The email addresses are not real currently but the club are looking into hosting the site online and all email addresses will be updated then.
