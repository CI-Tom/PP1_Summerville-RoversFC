            <p id="story">
                The story of Summerville Rovers is well documented both in Print &
                Picture. This is mainly down to the foresight of our founding members
                Aidan Corr & Charlie Elliott. Aidan has documented our first 40 years
                in existence with his two publications,
                <strong><em>"Silver Jubilee Special"</em></strong> and
                <strong><em>"40th Anniversary Club History"</em></strong>, and Charlie has amassed a large collection of
                photographs which
                have been added to by a succession of Club officials.
